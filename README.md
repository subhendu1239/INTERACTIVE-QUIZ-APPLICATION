* This repository contains a fully functional Quiz Application developed as part of my internship project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project was to build a responsive and interactive quiz platform that tests users' knowledge of front-end technologies—specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and provides instant feedback, scoring, and a dynamic user interface.

* Tech Stack
  
HTML5 for structuring content.

CSS3 for styling and layout design.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) for interactivity and dynamic behavior.

Visual Studio Code as the primary development environment.

* Features
  
-> 50 Handcrafted Questions on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

-> Dynamic Question Loading – Questions are loaded dynamically from a JavaScript array (quizData) to avoid hardcoding each one in the HTML file.

-> Radio Button Based Options – Each question presents four options using radio inputs, ensuring single-answer selection.

-> Real-Time Feedback – After each question, the user is immediately shown if their answer was correct or incorrect using color cues (green for correct, red for wrong).

-> Score Tracker – Score is calculated in real time and displayed at the end of the quiz.

-> Progress Bar – A visual progress bar that updates as the user progresses through the quiz.

-> Responsive UI – Designed with mobile and desktop compatibility in mind.

-> Restart Functionality – The user can restart the quiz and try again from the beginning.

-> Clean, Commented Code – Code is structured and commented for better understanding and scalability.

* Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code throughout the development process. VS Code's live server extension allowed me to test changes in real-time. The code editor's intelligent syntax highlighting, linting, and debugging tools made it easy to catch errors and organize code efficiently. I also made use of:

File Explorer for managing multiple assets (HTML, CSS, JS files)

Git Integration for source control and version tracking

Extensions like Prettier and Live Server to streamline the development experience

* Learning Outcomes

-> This project helped me:

Strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals, especially DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic.

Improve problem-solving skills by debugging user interaction issues.

Understand the workflow of real-world projects using version control and IDE tools.

Gain confidence in building user-centric features with clean UI/UX principles.

* Challenges Faced & How I Overcame Them
  
During the development of this quiz application, I encountered several challenges that tested both my technical knowledge and problem-solving skills. As an intern, this project served as a great learning experience and gave me a taste of real-world web development scenarios. Here are some of the key challenges I faced:

-> Initially, I found it difficult to dynamically update quiz content—such as loading questions, updating options, and handling user selections—without reloading the page. I had to revise my understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and how JavaScript interacts with it. By carefully using functions like querySelector, innerText, and event listeners, I was able to dynamically render questions and options on each click of the "Next" button.

-> Ensuring that the selected answer was accurately captured and validated proved challenging, especially when users skipped a question or didn't click any option. I implemented a robust validation system that checks whether an option is selected and then calculates the score accordingly. I also added visual cues (like color changes) to indicate correct or incorrect responses, which improved the user experience.

-> One tricky part was implementing the Restart Quiz feature. The state variables such as currentQuestion and score needed to be reset correctly, and the interface had to switch from the result screen back to the quiz screen. I also had to ensure that old selections were cleared and the progress bar reset. Debugging these logical errors helped improve my understanding of state management in JavaScript applications.

->Creating a clean, responsive UI was not easy at first. I had to experiment with various CSS properties like flexbox, media queries, and layout adjustments to ensure the quiz worked smoothly across different screen sizes. Learning by trial and error and testing on different devices really helped me understand how responsive design principles work in practice.

->Ensuring the quiz was not only functional but also accessible to users with different interaction patterns was another learning curve. I adjusted the radio button inputs and labels to ensure they could be selected by clicking anywhere on the option. This required adjusting both HTML structure and CSS styling for better usability.
